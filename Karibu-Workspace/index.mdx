## Karibu Workspace — API Reference

A compact technical reference for workspace operations. For conceptual guidance see the Guides: [Workspaces](/guides/workspaces). All endpoints require the X-API-Key header and operate within the authenticated user's scope.

### Common headers
- X-API-Key (string, required)

## Interactive playgrounds

The interactive API playground pages for workspace endpoints live under the
`endpoints/` folder. Each page is an MDX endpoint page which Mintlify can render
as an interactive playground when API settings are configured in `docs.json`.

- [Create Workspace](/Karibu-Workspace/endpoints/create-workspace)
- [List Workspaces](/Karibu-Workspace/endpoints/list-workspaces)
- [Get Workspace](/Karibu-Workspace/endpoints/get-workspace)
- [Update Workspace](/Karibu-Workspace/endpoints/update-workspace)

Interactive playgrounds are enabled globally in `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "openapi": ["openapi.json"],
  "api": {
    "playground": { "display": "interactive" },
    "mdx": {
      "server": ["https://api.example.com", "https://staging-api.example.com"],
      "auth": { "method": "key", "name": "X-API-Key", "placeholder": "sk_live_************************" }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also override playground settings per-page using frontmatter fields such as `playground: 'interactive'`.

### Notes and best practices

- Workspace IDs are UUIDs. Use them to scope calls and resources.
- Developer access is a per-workspace setting; enabling it allows creation of API clients (Developer Apps) scoped to that workspace.
- Always rotate and protect API keys. Keys grant access to all workspaces for the authenticated user.

If you need SDK examples or additional language code samples, request the specific language and we will add x-codeSamples for each endpoint.

Response 200:
```json
{ "workspace_id":"uuid", "user_id":"uuid", "name":"string", "description":"string", "created_at":"iso", "developer_access":true }
```

### List Workspaces
GET /v1/workspace/all/
Headers: X-API-Key
Response 200: array of workspace objects (same shape as above)
Errors: 401 / 422

### Get Workspace
GET /v1/workspace/{workspace_id}
Headers: X-API-Key
Path: workspace_id (UUID)
Response 200: single workspace object
Errors: 404 / 422

### Update Workspace
PUT /v1/workspace/{workspace_id}
Headers: X-API-Key
Request:
```json
{ "name":"string", "description":"string", "developer_access":true }
```
Response 200: updated workspace object
Errors: 422 — 
```json{ "detail":[{ "msg":"Invalid update request" }] }
```
- Workspace IDs are UUIDs and scope resources.
- Developer access enables creating Developer Apps for the workspace.
- Rotate and protect API keys; they grant access to all user workspaces.

If you want SDK examples for a specific language, request the language and code samples will be added.
