## Karibu Developer Apps — API Reference

A compact technical reference for developer apps operations. For conceptual guidance see the Guides: [Developer Apps](/guides/developer-apps). All endpoints require the X-API-Key header and operate within the authenticated user's workspace scope.

### Common headers
- X-API-Key (string, required)

## Developer Apps Guide

Developer Apps let you securely integrate your Briq workspace with external systems. They generate an **App Key** that works alongside your API Key to access restricted routes, such as OTP services.

### When to use Developer Apps

* If you want to connect Briq messaging or OTP to your mobile app, web service, or backend.
* If your workspace requires **developer access** (`developer_access = true`).

### Steps to Create and Use a Developer App

1. **Ensure your workspace has developer access**
   * Only workspaces created with `developer_access = true` can create and use developer apps.
   * This ensures your workspace is isolated and secure for API testing.

2. **Create a Developer App**
   * Use the `POST /v1/developer_apps/` endpoint.
   * Provide:
     * `app_name`: A descriptive name for your app.
     * `app_description`: Purpose of the app.
     * `workspace_id`: The ID of the workspace where this app belongs.

3. **Retrieve your App Key**
   * After creation, the app will have a unique `app_key`.
   * You'll use this key in OTP and other developer-restricted requests.

4. **Manage Developer Apps**
   * List apps by workspace, get by ID, update details, or delete apps.
   * Useful for rotating app keys, cleaning up old integrations, or auditing access.

5. **Use Developer Apps for OTP**
   * When requesting or verifying OTPs, both `X-API-Key` (your account key) and the `app_key` (developer app) must be provided.
   * Example:
     ```json
     {
       "phone_number": "+255712345678",
       "app_key": "devapp_123456",
       "sender_id": "BRIQ OTP",
       "otp_length": 6,
       "minutes_to_expire": 10,
       "delivery_method": "sms",
       "message_template": "Your OTP is {code}"
     }
     ```

6. **Best Practices**
   * Rotate `app_key` regularly to reduce risk if compromised.
   * Do not share your `app_key` publicly (treat it like a password).
   * Use separate apps per environment (development, staging, production).

## Interactive playgrounds

The interactive API playground pages for developer apps endpoints live under the
`endpoints/` folder. Each page is an MDX endpoint page which Mintlify can render
as an interactive playground when API settings are configured in `docs.json`.

### Notes and best practices

- Developer Apps are scoped to workspaces and require `developer_access = true`.
- App Keys (`app_key`) are used alongside API Keys for OTP and restricted endpoints.
- Always rotate app keys regularly and treat them as sensitive credentials.
- Use separate apps for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Deactivate unused apps by setting `is_active = false` instead of deleting them.

If you need SDK examples or additional language code samples, request the specific language and we will add x-codeSamples for each endpoint.
