# Security Notes

## Developer Access Restrictions

- Only authorized developers with valid API keys can access the Karibu API endpoints.
- API keys must be kept confidential and never shared publicly.
- All requests should be made over HTTPS to ensure data security.
- Monitor your API usage and rotate keys periodically.
- Contact support if you suspect unauthorized access or key compromise.

## Best Practices

- Validate all inputs and sanitize data before sending requests.
- Handle API errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
 - Review the [API Reference](/Karibu-Health/index) for endpoint-specific security requirements.
