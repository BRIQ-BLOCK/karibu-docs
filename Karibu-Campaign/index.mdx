## Karibu Campaign — API Reference

A compact technical reference for campaign operations. For conceptual guidance see the Guides: [Campaigns](/guides/campaigns). All endpoints require the X-API-Key header and operate within the authenticated user's workspace scope.

### Common headers
- X-API-Key (string, required)

## Campaigns Guide

Campaigns let you organize and send messages to groups of recipients under a workspace. They are typically used for marketing, notifications, or scheduled announcements. Each campaign belongs to a workspace, and can be linked with multiple messages.

### When to Use Campaigns

* **Bulk messaging**: Send one message to many recipients at once.
* **Workspace-level control**: Keep campaigns tied to a specific workspace.
* **Tracking**: Retrieve logs and reports for all messages sent under a campaign.
* **Integration**: Associate messages, groups, and sender IDs to specific campaigns.

### How Campaigns Work

1. A workspace must exist before creating a campaign.
2. Campaigns define the context for bulk messages (recipients, groups, sender IDs).
3. You can later retrieve campaign details or update metadata such as name or description.
4. Campaigns provide APIs for sending campaign-based messages.

### Available Operations

* **Create Campaign** → Define a new campaign under a workspace.
* **List Campaigns** → View all campaigns associated with your account.
* **Get Campaign** → Retrieve a campaign by its ID.
* **Update Campaign** → Modify campaign details.
* **Send Campaign Message** → Deliver messages through an existing campaign.

### Steps to Create and Use a Campaign

1. **Ensure you have a workspace**
   * Campaigns are scoped to workspaces. Create or select an existing workspace first.

2. **Create a Campaign**
   * Use the `POST /v1/campaigns/` endpoint.
   * Provide:
     * `campaign_name`: A descriptive name for your campaign.
     * `campaign_description`: Purpose of the campaign.
     * `workspace_id`: The ID of the workspace where this campaign belongs.

3. **Send Campaign Messages**
   * Use the campaign ID to send bulk messages to recipients.
   * Associate messages with groups, sender IDs, and delivery methods.

4. **Track Campaign Performance**
   * Retrieve campaign details to monitor message delivery status.
   * Use campaign logs for reporting and analytics.

### Best Practices

* Use descriptive campaign names to easily identify their purpose.
* Group related messages under the same campaign for better organization.
* Monitor campaign performance regularly to optimize delivery rates.
* Archive completed campaigns to keep your workspace organized.

## Interactive playgrounds

The interactive API playground pages for campaign endpoints live under the
`endpoints/` folder. Each page is an MDX endpoint page which Mintlify can render
as an interactive playground when API settings are configured in `docs.json`.

### Notes and best practices

- Campaigns are scoped to workspaces and help organize bulk messaging efforts.
- Use descriptive campaign names to easily identify their purpose.
- Monitor campaign performance through the `messages_sent` and `total_recipients` fields.
- Deactivate completed campaigns by setting `is_active = false` instead of deleting them.
- Use scheduled messaging to optimize delivery times for your audience.

If you need SDK examples or additional language code samples, request the specific language and we will add x-codeSamples for each endpoint.
