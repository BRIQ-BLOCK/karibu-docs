## Workspaces

Workspaces are isolated containers owned by a user that hold configuration, credentials, and resources (campaigns, messaging apps, OTP flows, developer apps). Use separate workspaces for teams, customers, or environments (staging/production).

### When to use a workspace

- Separate projects/customers or environments.
- Control ownership and access for resources.
- Enable Developer Apps when integrations or CI access are needed.

### Quick how-to

1. Decide the scope for the workspace (team, project, customer, or environment).
2. Create the workspace from the dashboard or API (set a name, optional description, and whether developer access should be enabled).
3. Configure workspace-level settings: default sender IDs, webhooks, and access policies.
4. Add resources: messaging apps, campaigns, and OTP flows.
5. If integrations or programmatic access are required, enable Developer Apps and create API clients scoped to the workspace.
6. Rotate keys and review access regularly; remove Developer Apps or users when they are no longer needed.

### Best practices and security

- Minimal access: enable developer access only where necessary.
- Key management: rotate API keys and Developer App credentials regularly.
- Audit: track which Developer Apps and API keys exist per workspace and remove unused credentials.

- If you want language-specific code samples or an interactive playground, say which language and we will add x-codeSamples to the API Reference.
