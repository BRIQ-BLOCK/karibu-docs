# Campaign Messages

Campaigns help you organize and manage bulk SMS messaging within workspaces, making it easy to group and track your messaging efforts effectively.

## What are Campaigns?

Campaigns are containers within workspaces designed for organizing bulk messaging. Each campaign is tied to a specific workspace and supports sending messages to multiple recipients.
