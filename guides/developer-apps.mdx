# Developer Apps

Developer Apps provide access to advanced Briq features, particularly OTP services. They act as secure integrations that can be linked to workspaces with developer access enabled.

## What are Developer Apps?

Developer Apps are client applications that enable access to OTP services and other developer-restricted features in the Briq platform. Currently, they are primarily used for OTP authentication flows.

### Key Characteristics
- **OTP Access**: Required for all OTP request and verification operations
- **Workspace Linking**: Must be linked to workspaces with developer access enabled
- **Secure Integration**: Provide controlled access to advanced features
- **Simple Management**: Easy creation and configuration

## Requirements for Developer Apps

### Workspace Access
- Developer apps can only work with workspaces that have `developer_access = true`
- You must enable developer access on your workspace before linking apps

### OTP Services  
- All OTP operations require a valid developer app ID
- OTP requests and verifications must include the developer app ID

## Managing Developer Apps

### Creating a Developer App

```bash
curl -X POST https://karibu.briq.tz/v1/developer-apps/create/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
-d '{
  "name": "My Authentication App",
  "description": "Developer app for OTP authentication services",
  "workspace_id": "ws_abc123xyz789def"
}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "developer_app_id": "dev_app_xyz789abc123",
  "name": "My Authentication App",
  "description": "Developer app for OTP authentication services", 
  "workspace_id": "ws_abc123xyz789def",
  "created_at": "2024-08-10T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Listing Developer Apps

```bash
curl -X GET https://karibu.briq.tz/v1/developer-apps/all/ \
-H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "developer_apps": [
    {
      "developer_app_id": "dev_app_xyz789abc123",
      "name": "My Authentication App",
      "description": "Developer app for OTP authentication services",
      "workspace_id": "ws_abc123xyz789def", 
      "created_at": "2024-08-10T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Getting Developer App Details

```bash
curl -X GET https://karibu.briq.tz/v1/developer-apps/dev_app_xyz789abc123 \
-H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here"
```

### Updating a Developer App

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://karibu.briq.tz/v1/developer-apps/update/dev_app_xyz789abc123 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
-d '{
  "name": "Updated Authentication App",
  "description": "Updated developer app for enhanced OTP services"
}'
```

## Best Practices

### Developer App Management
1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear names that indicate the app's purpose
2. **Workspace Linking**: Ensure apps are linked to workspaces with developer access
3. **Single Purpose**: Create separate apps for different services or environments
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and clean up unused apps

### Security Considerations
1. **Access Control**: Only create apps when necessary for OTP services
2. **Monitoring**: Track developer app usage and access patterns
3. **Documentation**: Keep records of what each app is used for
4. **Environment Separation**: Use different apps for development and production

### Integration Tips
1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for app creation and OTP calls
2. **ID Storage**: Securely store and manage developer app IDs
3. **Testing**: Test developer app functionality in development environments
4. **Logging**: Log developer app activities for debugging and monitoring
