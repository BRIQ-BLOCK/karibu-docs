# Campaign Messages

Campaigns provide a way to organize and manage bulk SMS messaging within workspaces. They help you group related messages and track your bulk messaging activities effectively.

## What are Campaigns?

Campaigns are containers within workspaces that help you organize your bulk messaging efforts. Each campaign belongs to a specific workspace and can be used to send messages to multiple recipients.

### Campaign vs Instant Messages

| Feature | Campaign Messages | Instant Messages |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Organization** | Grouped under campaigns in workspaces | Individual messages |
| **Recipients** | Multiple phone numbers | Single phone number |
| **Management** | Created and tracked within campaigns | Sent directly |
| **Use Case** | Bulk communications, marketing | Notifications, alerts |

## When to Use Campaigns

### Bulk Communications
- **Marketing**: Promotional messages to customer lists
- **Announcements**: Company updates to multiple recipients  
- **Events**: Invitations and event notifications
- **Newsletters**: Regular updates to subscriber lists

### Organization Benefits
- **Project Tracking**: Group messages by initiative or project
- **Workspace Management**: Keep campaigns organized within workspaces
- **Bulk Sending**: Send the same message to multiple recipients efficiently
