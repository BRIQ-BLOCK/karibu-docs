# Messaging

Messaging allows you to communicate directly with your users via SMS. Briq provides two main ways to send messages:

- Instant Messages → Send a single or small batch of messages immediately.  
- Campaign Messages → Send messages at scale, to large groups, often with scheduling or personalization.

## When to Use Messaging

- Notifications - order updates, delivery confirmations, password resets.  
- Marketing Campaigns - promotions, offers, event invitations.  
- Service Alerts - downtime notices, reminders, system warnings. 

## How Messaging Works

1. Compose a Message → Define recipient(s), message content, and sender ID.  
2. Send Message → Use Instant Message API for one-off messages or Campaign API for bulk sends.  
3. Track Delivery → Delivery reports provide status updates for each message (e.g., SENT, DELIVERED, FAILED).

## Messaging Types

### Instant Messages
- Best for real-time alerts or low-volume communication.  
- Example: “Your verification code is 123456.”

### Campaign Messages
- Best for marketing or bulk communication.  
- Supports scheduling, targeting, and personalization.  
- Example: “Get 20% off all items this weekend at BriqStore. Visit briqstore.com.”

## Example Workflow

### Sending an Instant Message
```json
{
  "recipient": "255712345678",
  "message": "Hello, your order has been confirmed!",
  "sender_id": "BRIQ"
}
```
Response:
```json
{ "message_id": "uuid", "status": "sent" }
```

### Sending a Campaign Message
```json
{
  "recipients": ["255712345678","255713987654"],
  "message": "Flash Sale! 30% off all items today only!",
  "sender_id": "BRIQ",
  "schedule_time": "2025-08-22T18:00:00Z"
}
```
Response:
```json
{ "campaign_id": "uuid", "status": "scheduled", "total_recipients": 2 }
```

## Delivery Reports

- Each message or campaign can generate a delivery report with statuses such as:
  - SENT - message accepted by the gateway
  - DELIVERED - message reached the recipient’s device
  - FAILED - message could not be delivered

## Best Practices

- Use Instant Messages for critical, time-sensitive updates.  
- Use Campaign Messages for marketing, respecting opt-in/opt-out laws.  
- Capture delivery reports to monitor success and troubleshoot failures.  
- Segment audiences for more effective campaigns.  
- Schedule sends to match recipient time zones and peak engagement windows.
