# Best Practices

## Sender ID

- Use 3–11 characters; A–Z, 0–9; avoid special chars.
- Choose a recognizable brand; keep consistent across messages.
- Some regions require pre-registration; plan lead time.

## OTP settings

- Expiry: 2–5 minutes is typical; balance UX and security.
- Length: 4–6 digits; avoid predictable sequences.
- Limit attempts and add cool-down after repeated failures.

## Campaigns vs. Instant

- Use Campaigns for bulk sends, scheduling, and analytics.
- Use Instant for transactional messages (receipts, OTPs).
- Segment recipients and personalize content when possible.

## Content quality

- Keep messages concise; include clear call-to-action.
- Localize language; consider Swahili voice/WhatsApp where relevant.

## Deliverability

- Respect quiet hours and regional regulations.
- Prefer opt-in lists; include STOP/HELP where required.

## Security

- Never log API keys or OTP codes.
- Rotate keys periodically; use per-environment keys.
- Restrict developer access per workspace.
